# Family Talk

This was a group project while I studied at DevPoint labs.  It allows users to create a board with a specific topic, add posts to that board, add comments to the posts, like comments and posts, and follow boards they find interesting.  I contributed the most to the like functionality, follow board feature, comment components, and sorting features.  The project uses authetication, image uploads, and all CRUD actions for users, boards, posts, and comments.
